## Problem 1
In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the effects of several variables on a childâ€™s birthweight. This dataset consists of roughly 4000 children. 

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).
