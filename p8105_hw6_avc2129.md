## Problem 1

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e.Â convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

``` r
birthweight_data = read_csv(file = "./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = 
      recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
      babysex = factor(babysex),
    frace = 
      recode(frace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black", 
             "3" = "asian", "4" = "puerto_rican", 
             "8" = "other", "9" = "unknown"),
      frace = factor(frace),
    malform = 
      recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present"),
      malform = factor(malform),
    mrace =
      recode(mrace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black",
             "3" = "asian", "4" = "puerto_rican",
             "8" = "other"),
      mrace = factor(mrace)
  ) %>% view()
```

    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.
